# Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) Context

## Inventory Organization Best Practices

### Use Groups for Sorting and Filtering
- AAP inventories organize hosts into **groups** for easier management
- Common groups include: `os_windows`, `os_linux`, `os_rhel`, `os_amazon`, etc.
- When querying hosts by OS or other criteria, **always check inventory groups first**
- Use `groups_list` to find relevant groups within an inventory
- Query hosts within specific groups rather than filtering all hosts manually

### Example Workflow for OS-Based Queries:
1. List inventory groups: `groups_list` with inventory context
2. Identify relevant group (e.g., `os_windows` for Windows hosts)
3. Query hosts within that specific group for accurate counts/details

## Host Variables for OS Detection

### Using Host Variables (host.variables)
- Each host has a `variables` field containing important metadata
- Common OS-related variables:
  - `ansible_facts.os_family` (e.g., "Windows", "RedHat", "Debian")
  - `ansible_facts.distribution` (e.g., "Ubuntu", "CentOS", "Amazon")
  - `ansible_facts.system` (e.g., "Linux", "Win32NT")
  - `os` or `operating_system` (custom variables)
- Variables are stored as JSON strings and need to be parsed

### Host Variable Parsing Strategy:
- Use `hosts_list` to retrieve host details including variables
- Parse the `variables` field (usually JSON) to extract OS information
- Look for ansible_facts first, then fall back to custom variables

## AAP API Patterns

### Pagination
- Default page size: typically 50-200 results
- Always check the `count` field for total items
- Use `page` and `page_size` parameters to retrieve all results
- If count > page_size, iterate through all pages

### Resource Relationships
- Inventories contain Groups and Hosts
- Groups contain Hosts
- Hosts belong to one Inventory and zero or more Groups
- Use group membership for efficient filtering

## Query Strategy for Common Tasks

### "How many Windows hosts?"
1. Use `groups_list` to find the `os_windows` group
2. Get the group details which includes host count
3. Or query `hosts_list` filtered to that group

### "List all hosts by OS"
1. List all groups to identify OS-based groups
2. Query each group for its hosts
3. Alternatively, retrieve all hosts and parse their `variables` field

### "What OS is host X running?"
1. Use `hosts_retrieve` to get host details
2. Parse the `variables` field
3. Look for `ansible_facts.os_family` or similar fields

## MCP Tool Preferences
- Use AAP MCP tools (`mcp_aap-management_*`) over curl commands
- Tools handle authentication and formatting automatically
- Always check tool output for pagination hints (`next`, `previous`, `count`)
